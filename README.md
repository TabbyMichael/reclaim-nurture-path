## Our Story
### A Personal Journey to Recovery
Reclaim was born from our founder's personal struggle with addiction and the realization that recovery requires more than just willpowerâ€”it demands community, structure, and accessible resources.

After years of battling addiction and experiencing the gaps in traditional recovery approaches, our team set out to create a comprehensive digital solution that combines evidence-based practices with modern technology.

Today, Reclaim serves thousands of individuals on their recovery journeys, providing the tools, support, and community needed to overcome addiction and behavioral challenges.

> *"We created Reclaim to be the resource I wish I had during my darkest momentsâ€”a companion that understands the journey and provides the right support at the right time."*
